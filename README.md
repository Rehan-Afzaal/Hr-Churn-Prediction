# Employee Turnover Predictor

![Project Logo](logo.png)

## Introduction
Welcome to the Employee Turnover Predictor! This project aims to help organizations forecast and mitigate employee churn, enabling them to retain valuable talent and maintain a productive workforce. By leveraging machine learning techniques, we have developed a predictive model that can accurately identify employees at risk of leaving the company.

Employee turnover can have significant impacts on a company's performance, culture, and bottom line. Understanding the factors that contribute to employee churn and having the ability to predict it in advance can provide organizations with the insights needed to implement proactive retention strategies, improve employee satisfaction, and foster a positive work environment.

## Features
- Data preprocessing and feature engineering: Prepare the employee data for analysis by cleaning, transforming, and selecting relevant features.
- Machine learning model training and evaluation: Build a predictive model using various algorithms and evaluate its performance to select the best approach.
- Churn prediction and risk assessment: Utilize the trained model to predict the likelihood of employees leaving the company and assess the risk associated with each individual.
- Insights and visualizations: Gain valuable insights from the data and generate visualizations to understand the key factors influencing turnover and identify patterns.
- Recommendations for retention strategies: Based on the predicted churn probability, provide recommendations for targeted retention strategies and interventions to reduce employee turnover.
